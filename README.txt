BR=Binocular Rivalry
Rpl_smt=Replay smooth

In the *Condition*_results2.mat file, there are the following variables: FO, cond_sub, SR, sumlife, mean_Y, mean_g, mean_intervals, mean_lifetimes, which correspond to fractonal occupancy, subjects, switching rate, total state lifetime, behaviour covariates, gamma, the interval between the state "up" moments, and (segmented) state lifetime for every trial. A trial is one epoch before a motor response. Note that these variables are all averaged across 276 timepoints of the trial. (It was 276 instead of 260 becuase I used 0.1s after motor onset as padding)

- about state lifetime:
	- total statelifetime = sum(segmented state lifetime)
	- it was segmented becuase states are up and down intermittently.
	- to recover the state lifecourse across time, you need to use the state onsets, lifetimes/intervals. I have only estimated them for the state 4 during the BR_dominant condition. (variables: "BR_dominant_k4_onsets/lifetimes/intervals")

- about behaviour covariates:
	- mean_Y has 10 columns, but you only need the first two columns: Lat_before and Lat_after, corresponding to perception duration (latency) before and after the motor response.

1.2 run1.mat                |
----------------------------

The hmm output generated by the toolbox. 
Gamma is the state activity, concatenated across all subjs, sessions, trials.
There are 276-14 = 262 timepoints for each trial in the Gamma. "-14" because the there are 14 points around each time point used for calculating autocorrelation.
To know the info of trials, see the data.mat.


======================================================================================
2. HMM_meta_output.mat

It has 4 variables: X, Y, T, Sub
 - T: indicates how many timepoints for each trial. length(T) = total number of trials 
 - Sub: indicates from which subjects this trial is recorded
 - X: source signals for 8 ROIs, which are {'rHP', 'lHP', 'lIPL', 'rIPL', 'PCU','PCC', 'ACC', 'V1'} in order
 - Y: dependent variables (10), which are Lat_before (1), Lat_after (1), Rsp_moments (2), CDT_code (6).
 	- Lat_before & Lat_after are the latency before and after a motor response
	- CDT_code = CONDITION code: when the value in the corresponding column is 1, it means this trial is recorded from this condition. The corresponding conditions are {'BR_dominant',  'BR_mixed', 'Rpl_smt_dominant',  'Rpl_smt_mixed','Rpl_ins_dominant',  'Rpl_ins_mixed'} in order.

btw: Rpl_ins is Replay_instantaneous, which I didn't consider for stats, because it has much fewer sessions compared to Replay_smooth and BR.
